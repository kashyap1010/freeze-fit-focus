              Greens powders are dietary supplements made from dried and powdered vegetables, fruits, algae, and other plant-based ingredients. They're designed to provide a concentrated source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
            </InfoBox>

            <h2>Benefits of Greens Powders</h2>
            <p>Greens powders offer several potential health benefits, though it's important to note that they should supplement, not replace, whole foods in your diet.</p>

            <h3>1. Increased Nutrient Intake</h3>
            <p>A quality greens powder can help bridge nutritional gaps in your diet, providing vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds that you might not get enough of from your regular meals.</p>

            <h3>2. Antioxidant Support</h3>
            <p>Many ingredients in greens powders are rich in antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress and support overall health.</p>

            <h3>3. Digestive Health</h3>
            <p>Many greens powders contain probiotics and digestive enzymes that may support gut health and improve digestion.</p>

            <QuoteBlock author="Dr. Sarah Johnson" source="Clinical Nutrition Journal">
              While greens powders shouldn't replace fresh vegetables and fruits, they can be valuable supplements for those struggling to meet their daily vegetable intake requirements.

            <h2>How to Choose the Right Greens Powder</h2>
            <p>With countless options on the market, choosing the right greens powder can be overwhelming. Here are some factors to consider:</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>Look for products with a transparent ingredient list. Avoid those with artificial additives, fillers, or excessive sugars.</p>

            <h3>Third-Party Testing</h3>
            <p>Choose products that have been tested by third-party organizations for quality and purity.</p>

            <h3>Nutritional Profile</h3>
            <p>Review the nutritional information to ensure the product provides a substantial amount of the nutrients you're seeking.</p>

            <InfoBox variant="warning">
              Always consult with your healthcare provider before adding any supplement to your routine, especially if you're pregnant, nursing, or taking medications.

              Superfoods are nutrient-rich foods considered to be especially beneficial for health and well-being. They're packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other compounds that support optimal body function.
            </InfoBox>

            <h2>Understanding Immune System Support</h2>
            <p>Your immune system is your body's natural defense mechanism against harmful pathogens. While no single food can prevent illness, a nutrient-rich diet can help support immune function and potentially reduce the risk of illness.</p>

            <QuoteBlock author="Dr. Andrew Weil" source="Eating Well for Optimum Health">
              The food you eat can be either the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison.

            <h2>Top 10 Immune-Boosting Superfoods</h2>
            <p>Here are ten scientifically-validated superfoods that can help strengthen your immune system:</p>

            <h3>1. Citrus Fruits</h3>
            <InfoBox variant="success">
              Citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruits, and lemons are high in vitamin C, which may help increase white blood cell productionâ€”key players in fighting infections.
            </InfoBox>

            <h3>2. Berries</h3>
            <p>Berries contain powerful antioxidants called anthocyanins that have immune-supporting properties. Blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries are particularly beneficial.</p>

            <h3>3. Garlic</h3>
            <Callout>
              Garlic contains compounds like allicin that have been shown to boost the disease-fighting response of white blood cells when they encounter viruses.
            </Callout>

            <h3>4. Ginger</h3>
            <p>Ginger has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, can help reduce chronic pain, and may even help fight infections.</p>

            <h3>5. Spinach</h3>
            <p>Rich in vitamin C, numerous antioxidants, and beta-carotene, spinach is healthiest when cooked as little as possible to retain its nutrients.</p>

            <h3>6. Yogurt</h3>
            <p>Look for yogurts that contain live and active cultures, which may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases.</p>

            <h3>7. Almonds</h3>
            <p>Vitamin E, which is abundant in almonds, is key to a healthy immune system. It's a fat-soluble vitamin, which means it requires the presence of fat to be absorbed properly.</p>

            <h3>8. Turmeric</h3>
            <p>The main active component in turmeric, curcumin, has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.</p>

            <h3>9. Green Tea</h3>
            <p>Both green and black teas are packed with flavonoids, a type of antioxidant. Green tea also contains high levels of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), another powerful antioxidant.</p>

            <h3>10. Broccoli</h3>
